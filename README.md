# ApartmentScraper
Simple webscraper that helps me to find a place to live


### Background

In the search for an apartment, I signed up to way too many viewings. This application helps me to organise my viewings in a excel-sheet. I made this application just because it too hard to copy information about an apartement into my excel sheet. 

The program uses serium's webdriver to extract XPATH's from a finn.no. You can change the XPATH's to any other website. This version is only for apartments, not for anything else.
